# Form3D-Audio
An audio reactive toy based on the old 90's DOS Genetic Art program 'Form' by Andrew Rowbottom. Re-developed in Unity 5 it demonstrates the use of custom shaders within the Unity framework.


CoreShader: Implements bespoke ambient, diffuse and specular lighting with real environmental fresnel reflections. The core also implements a glow effect that is responsive to the music playing. 
FrameShader: Implements bespoke ambient, diffuse and specular lighting with real environmental fresnel reflections.
BackgroundShader: The background shader is displayed on a simple quad (not a lightbox) that is resposive to the camera position.
LensShader: Provides a VGA monitor and scene transition effects.
